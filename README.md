- 👋 Hi, I’m @bru-or, you can call me Bru
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the area of ​​data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... so many things!!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with IT professionals who want to develop interpersonal skills while I learn more about programming and data processing. Shall we make this exchange?
- 📫 How to reach me: boromeiro@alumni.usp.br
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first experience with programming was traumatizing! I gave up for a long time, left my IS degree, and graduated in Business Administration instead. I worked on the other side (as a proficient user), but I never fully left the field. And here I am, coming back... Oops!
